Garud Iyengar’s research is focused on understanding uncertain systems and
exploiting available information using data-driven control and
optimization algorithms.  He and his students have explored
applications in many diverse fields, such as machine learning,
systemic risk, asset management, operations management, sports
analytics, and biology.  
 
Iyengar received a B Tech in electrical engineering from the Indian
Institute of Technology in 1993 and a PhD in electrical engineering from
Stanford University in 1998. He is a member of Columbia’s Data Science
Institute.
