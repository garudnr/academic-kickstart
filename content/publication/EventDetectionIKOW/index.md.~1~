abstract: We propose a unsupervised learning framework for automatically labeling events in a basketball game. Our framework uses the the optical player tracking data in the NBA. We first learn the time series of defensive assignments using a novel player and location dependentattraction based model which uses hidden Markov models (HMMs), Gaussianprocesses, and a “bond breaking” model for changes in defensiveassignments. Next, we use the learned defensive assignments as an input toa set of HMMs that automatically detect events such as ball screens,drives and post-ups. We show that our models provide significantimprovements over existing benchmarks both on defensive assignments andevent detection.
